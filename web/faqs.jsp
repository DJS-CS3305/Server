                    Q: How do I access the course booking forms online?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A: Simply click on the link for registering for a course inside the course page
                </p>
                
                <h3>
                    Q: I have completed the booking form, how do I know if its gone through? 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A: If you have filled in all the necessary fields (those marked with a *) and 
                    submitted, you should see that the course has been added to your profile
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Q: Is it possible to keep a copy of my form?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A: Yes, it is possible to keep a copy. Just use the print function in your browser
                </p>
                
                <h3>
                    Q: Is it possible to book myself into more than one course who's timetables clash?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A: No, as it is impossible for you to attend 2 courses at the same time, our system will 
                    prevent you from being able to do this
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Q: Can I cancel a course and get a refund?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A: You need to contact us directly to cancel a course and ask for a refund. The refund will 
                    only be issued if you have a valid and reasonable claim
                </p>
