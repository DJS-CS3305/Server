                The university was founded in 1845 as one of three Queenâ€™s Colleges 
                located in Belfast, Cork, and Galway. It became University College, 
                Cork, under the Irish Universities Act of 1908. The Universities Act 
                1997 renamed the university as National University of Ireland, Cork, 
                and a Ministerial Order of 1998 renamed the university as University
                College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork, though it 
                continues to be almost universally known as University College Cork
